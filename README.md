# ADM-HW4 - Hard coding

## Purpose

The goal of the project is write important algorithms and functions from scratch.

The algorithm implemented were:
- hash function CRC
- hyperloglog
- KMeans

## Data
The datasets used are 
- available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19SD2db0dH2A0QLJOmBHnkbqOX6SbERcY/view?usp=sharing) for the test of the hyperloglog,
- and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) for the clustering part.

## Content
The repository contains:
1. **`Reviews.ipynb`**:
	> the Jupyter notebook  that contains all the answers to the homework.
